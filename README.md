# Modelling of francis turbine in matlab
 
The Francis turbine is the most popular hydro turbine due to its ability to work well over a
broad range and its high efficiency. Its important part, the runner, is connected to the common
shaft of the electrical generator. Thus, the design of the runner plays a vital role in the operation
of the machine.
We aim to model the blade profile and runner of the Francis turbine. Among the many
design approaches (Direct method, indirect method, Bovet method, and curve fitting), the Bovet
method has been used to obtain the blade profile as it is found that this method provides the
blade profile in the most efficient way.
Based on the given input parameters: net head, discharge rate, and speed of the runner,
we calculated the inlet and outlet parameters. The implementation of the Bovet Method is
facilitated through computational tools, particularly MATLAB. We then plot the Meridional
View, Perpendicular view, Axial view, and 3D design of the runner blade. The finding of this
study helps to contribute to the design of runners by a systematic approach to the calculation of
its parameters.
